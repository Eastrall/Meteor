Meteor
======

Meteor is a C# open-source CFlyFF (Chinese FlyFF) emulator based on lesderid's open source emulator : https://github.com/lesderid/XinFeiFei

I suggest you to read the full README.md of XinFeiFei emulator.

We develop this emulator for fun and for learn more about C# and network apps.
